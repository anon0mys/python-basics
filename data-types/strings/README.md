The `test_strings.py` file has a number of exercises to help you better work with strings in python.

1. Make sure you followed the instructions listed in `README.md` in the root python-basics folder to install `pytest`
2. Open `test_strings.py` in your editor
3. In terminal, use `pytest` to run the tests
  * **NOTE:** Test files (start or end with test, `example_test.py`) execute with `pytest` instead of the `python` command you are used to
4. Read the error message, fill the blanks in each `test_strings.py` test, save the file, and execute until each test passes
  * **NOTE:** Remove the `@pytest.mark.skip` decorator above each test function to enable each test as you go
